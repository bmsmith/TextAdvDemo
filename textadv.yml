             A Canterlot Burglar
             
             
             A happy pegasus alighted on a tower balcony and began to sing.
             This affront was completely uncalled for and would not go unpunished.
             Within the tower, in a dusty old wood-and-plaster room, another pegasus stirred at the sound of the tone-deaf pony. She rolled over, landing on the mass of bandages that made up her right wing, and awoke from the pain.
             Sky Runner's eye flickered open.

             You see a small book, bound with leather and closed with a gold clasp. Luckily it looks unlocked. Brand new, too!
